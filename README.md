# wordle
My version of the Wordle Game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Usage
Run the index.html in any browser to launch the game. Use your keyboard to enter the letters of the word. Hit Enter or click the Submit button after entering your word.

# Word List
The game uses two word lists. 
* The array 'allWords' in 'wordList.js' contains all five letter words. The game uses this list to check if a valid five letter word was entered. 
* The secret word is randomly picked from the array 'words' in 'easyWordList.js'. Modify this list to change the difficulty of words generated.

# Difficulty
The secret word is generated randomly from the array 'words' in file 'easyWordList.js'. Add or remove words from this list to change difficulty.
